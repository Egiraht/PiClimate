# PiClimate.Monitor

**PiClimate.Monitor** is a web server used for climatic data visualization.

## Features

Climatic data are acquired by the server using the measurement data source concept.
At the moment these data sources are provided:

* **MySqlSource** - acquires the climatic data from the specified MySQL database,
* **RandomDataSource** - generates random climatic data for testing purposes (selected by default).

By accessing the web server page, collected data can further be visualized using charts for selected time periods.

## Settings

The program can be configured using the *Settings.json* file. This file is automatically generated in the program's root
directory after the first run. The comments in the file help to understand the meaning of each setting and describe
values it can accept.

Also any individual setting from the settings file can be additionally overriden on program start by adding
corresponding command line arguments with the common syntax of `--parameter=value` for parameters in the root section.
Parameters in deeply nested sections can be addressed using the `:` delimiter: `--section:subsection:parameter=value`.

## Requirements

The program requires the *.NET Runtime 5.0* and *ASP.NET Core Runtime 5.0* packages to be installed in the system.

## References

The program is based on the open-source *.NET* framework. Also for functioning it uses these third-party open-source
libraries:

* **Dapper** - the SQL query object mapper.
* **MySqlConnector** - the MySQL database driver.
* **jQuery** - the JavaScript library used for web page DOM manipulation.
* **Chart.js** - the JavaScript chart-based data visualization library.
* **Moment.js** - the JavaScript date-time manipulation library.
* **Bootstrap** - the CSS framework for the frontend.
