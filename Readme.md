# PiClimate

PiClimate is a software for logging and displaying climatic data.

It consists of two parts:

* **PiClimate.Logger** service is responsible for data measuring and logging.
* **PiClimate.Monitor** represents a web server used for the stored data visualization.

Using this software the climatic data can be measured using various data providers such as hardware sensors, and then
can be logged to data storages like SQL databases. The logged data can be visualized as parametric charts for selected
time periods.

For more detailed information see the *Readme* files in the corresponding project directories.
