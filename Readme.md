# PiClimate

PiClimate is a software for logging and displaying climatic data.

It consists of two parts:
* **PiClimate.Logger** service is responsible for data measuring and logging.
* **PiClimate.Monitor** represents a web server used for the stored data visualization.

The climatic data are measured by the data providers such as hardware sensors and logged to the data storage
like SQL databases. The logged data can then be displayed as parametric charts for selected time periods.

For more detailed information see the *Readme* files in the corresponding project directories.
